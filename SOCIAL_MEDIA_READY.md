# 📢 SOCIAL MEDIA LAUNCH KIT

## 🔴 Option A: Reddit (r/DnD, r/DMAcademy)

**Title:** I built a "Cursed" Dashboard for my campaign because normal VTTs weren't stressful enough.

**Body:**
> Hey everyone,
>
> My players are running a homebrew campaign called "Heart's Curse" where they have 21 days to stop a magical plague. I wanted the pressure to feel *real*, so I built a custom DM Dashboard that actually "rots" as the in-game days pass.
>
> **The App Features:**
> *   **Dynamic Curse Tracker:** The UI glitches and turns redder as the curse level rises.
> *   **Interactive Spire Map:** I can toggle "Safe Zones" and update the dungeon state live.
> *   **The Grimoire:** Quick spell/monster lookup without leaving the vibe of the dashboard.
>
> It’s built with Next.js and Tailwind. It’s not meant to replace Foundry/Roll20 for grid combat, but to act as a "Command Center" for the narrative layer.
>
> [Link to Demo Video]
> [Link to GitHub / Project]
>
> Let me know if you think your players would hate seeing this countdown every session! 😈
