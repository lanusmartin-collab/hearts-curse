# Heart's Curse: Marketing & Publication Strategy

## 1. Product Positioning
**Tagline:** "Survive the Curse. Manage the Heart. All in one tab."
**Unique Selling Point (USP):**
*   **The Curse Mechanic:** A visual, ticking clock that DMs can share with players.
*   **Aesthetics:** "AD&D Book Cover" vibes mixed with "Neon Dark Fantasy". High-immersion UI.
*   **Specialized:** Not a generic VTT. Tailored specifically for the "Heart's Curse" darker campaign style or high-stakes modules.

## 2. Launch Preparation (Pre-Flight)
*   **Polish the "First 5 Seconds":** Ensure the Landing Page (Dashboard) looks absolutely stunning. The "Heartbeat" animation and the Hero Image are your strongest assets.
*   **Demo Mode:** Create a "Read-Only" version or a video walkthrough so people can see it without deploying it themselves immediately.
*   **Media Kit:**
    *   high-res screenshots of the Dashboard, Spire Map, and Curse Tracker (especially the "Critical" red state).
    *   A 30-second "Trailer" video showing the UI glitch animations and the curse progressing.

## 3. Outreach Channels & Strategy

### A. Reddit (The TTRPG Core)
*   **Subreddits:** r/DnD, r/DMAcademy, r/dndnext, r/UnearthedArcana (for the mechanics/monsters).
*   **Strategy:** "I built a dedicated Curse Tracker app for my campaign because generic VTTs weren't scary enough."
    *   Post a short video (GIF) of the Curse Tracker escalating from "Latent" to "Critical".
    *   Provide a link to the GitHub repo (or hosted site).
    *   Ask for feedback on the *mechanics* (Safe Haven rules etc.) to engage discussion.

### B. Social Media (Visuals First)
*   **Twitter/X:** Use hashtags #dnd #ttrpg #indiedev. Post "UI appreciation" shots. Tag popular D&D accounts/creators if relevant (but don't spam).
*   **TikTok / Youtube Shorts:** Vertical video of the "Heart's Curse" UI.
    *   Voiceover: "POV: Your players triggered the Curse and the UI starts bleeding."
    *   Show the transition from clean UI to glitched/cursed UI.

### C. Community Hubs
*   **Discord:** Create a small Discord server for "Heart's Curse" DMs to share their campaign stories and report bugs.
*   **Itch.io:** Publish the web app (or a link to it) as a tool on Itch.io. It has a great TTRPG community.

## 4. Launch Event Ideas
*   **"The Cursed Release":** Release the app at midnight. Theme the announcement around "unleashing" it.
*   **Open Playtest:** Invite 10 DMs to run a one-shot using the app and provide feedback.
*   **Feature Countdown:** Reveal one major feature per day for a week (e.g., "Day 1: The Spire", "Day 2: The Shops", "Day 3: The Curse").

## 5. Launch Strategy: "The Whispering Glitch"
*   **Concept**: The VTT isn't just a tool; it's a cursed artifact.
*   **The Hook**: "I got tired of Excel-sheet VTTs. So I built one that acts like a forbidden tome."
*   **Assets Ready**:
    *   [x] **Glitch Trailer**: Showcasing the "Pulse" and "Decay" animations.
    *   [x] **Critical State**: Screenshot of Day 21 (Red UI).

## 6. Post-Launch Retention
*   **Updates:** Regular "Grimoire Updates" (new spells) or "Bestiary Expansions" (new monsters).
*   **User Content:** specific distinct styles for "Safe Havens" or "Loot Tables" that users can submit.

## Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)
1.  [x] **Capture:** Record a 30s video of the Curse Tracker and Map interactions.
2.  [ ] **Package:** Ensure `README.md` is perfect and explains how to run the app.
3.  [ ] **Tease:** Post one screenshot to r/DnD with the title "Working on a UI that gets more corrupted as the campaign progresses."
